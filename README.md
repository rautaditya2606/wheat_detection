# Wheat Disease Classifier

A web application that uses deep learning to identify wheat diseases from images of wheat crops and leaves.

## Features

- Upload images of wheat crops or leaves
- Get instant predictions about potential diseases
- View confidence scores for predictions
- Mobile-responsive design
- Drag and drop file upload

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd wheat-disease-classifier
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

1. Make sure you have the model file `wheat_resnet50.pt` in the project root directory.

2. Start the Flask development server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```
